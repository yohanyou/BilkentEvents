# **Welcome to Bilkent Events!**
## Introduction:
We, the Renaissance team, wanted to improve Bilkent's SRS system to make it so it is more user-friendly and easier to access.
We decided to design a mobile application where users can create an account using their Bilkent ID's, and then they will be able to create, access, and apply to certain events.

## How to Setup:
First of all, you have to either clone the repository or directly open it in android studio.
Afterwards, you have to *build* the application and then run it on your respective android phone or emulation.
Then, you are able to start using the application!

## Special Thanks:
Our lead coder Ali Majidi,
Our hardworking coder Kenan Zeynalov,
and our great UI designers Maryam Azimli and Yohan You.

everyone has contributed to a portion of this code, and I am greatful to be part of this team.
